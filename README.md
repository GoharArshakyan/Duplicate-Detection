# Duplicate-Detection
Task 3

For this task, I first started to import the necessary package. I then loaded the csv datafile and started to inspect the data. I did some basic EDA for this task such as checking
the data types, the dimensions, missing values. Since the purpose of this task is to detect duplicate values, I left the missing values as it is. I started to identify the amount of duplicates there are in the data, after which I displayed all the duplicated datapoints. Finally, I saved the duplicated datapoints to a different csv file called "Duplicates".
